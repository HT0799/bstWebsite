    "description": "AC disc suspension insulators are mainly used in AC transmission lines. When using them, it is necessary to select different sizes of insulators based on indicators such as small mechanical holes and insulation resistance. The selection of insulators should be based on operating voltage, insulation performance, and operating environment, avoiding mountain or valley areas. In regions with water vapor diffusion, through long-term research work in the Arctic cold climate, our products are better and are applied in areas such as power transmission lines and electrification."
